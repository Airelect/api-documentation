====
'''
Question::
====
Why do i receive `HTTP 100 Continue`  responses sometimes?
====
Answer::
====
This is something our framework sends when it has received the request headers and
indicates that the client should proceed to send the request body. What you can do is investigate
 the reason why your code does this, or you could traverse the headers until
you find a header with the intended response code, examples https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14526627/double-http-status-header-on-http-post-to-jersey[Here]
and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2964687/how-to-handle-100-continue-http-message[Here].

Question::
====
Once I have a Access token, how do I use it to authenticate myself?
====

Answer::
====
The Access token is passed through the `Authorization` header with the format:
`Authorization: Bearer <Token>`. Also note that on most services you can use the *_self_*
filter instead of `{organizationUuid}`

Question::
====
I cannot upload images using byte arrays.
====
Answer::
====
In the Swagger documentation it specifies the data as a array of String, this is not true, make sure that
The byte array is in the form:

[source]
--
"imageData": [-1, -40, -1, -31, 0, 24, 69, 120, 105]
--

and not:

[source]
--
"imageData": "[-1, -40, -1, -31, 0, 24, 69, 120, 105]"
