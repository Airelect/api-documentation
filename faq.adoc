### General questions

___

##### Question:
> Why do i receive `HTTP 100 Continue`  responses sometimes?

##### Answer:

> This is something our framework sends when it has received the request headers and
indicates that the client should proceed to send the request body. What you can do is investigate
 the reason why your code does this, or you could traverse the headers until
you find a header with the intended response code, examples [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14526627/double-http-status-header-on-http-post-to-jersey)
and [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2964687/how-to-handle-100-continue-http-message).

filter instead of `{organizationUuid}`

The byte array is in the form: ` "imageData": [-1, -40, -1, -31, 0, 24, 69, 120, 105]` and not
` "imageData": "[-1, -40, -1, -31, 0, 24, 69, 120, 105]"`
