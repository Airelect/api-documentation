For inventory we use a concept of transactions, where we always move stock between so called `Locations`.
Locations are created automatically when tracking is enabled on any product. The locations that currently exists and the natural flow of stock balance is shown below:
```
                  > BIN
SUPPLIER > STORE
                  > SOLD
```
`SUPPLIER` is an abstraction of a supplier and holds infinite stock.

`STORE` is the location of the current stock for a variant.

`BIN & SOLD` are abstractions for when a product is sold or discarded.

An important note is that you cannot directly set a stock balance for a variant.
If you want to set an absolute value of a variant you need to calculate the change needed to reach that stock value.

#### Example 1:
`PUT /organizations/{organizationUuid}/inventory`

I have 30 stock in `STORE` and I want to set that to 20. Then I move 10 stock to `SOLD`, `BIN` or `SUPPLIER` location (depending on the reason for the stock change), note that we always move positive numbers.

```
  "productUuid": <uuid>
  "variantUuid": <uuid>,
  "fromLocationUuid": <STORE_location_uuid>,
  "toLocationUuid": “<SOLD_location_uuid>,
  "change": 10
```

#### Example 2:
`PUT /organizations/{organizationUuid}/inventory`

I have 30 in stock and want to set to 40, then we move 10 stock from `SUPPLIER` to `STORE`

```
  "productUuid": <uuid>
  "variantUuid": <uuid>,
  "fromLocationUuid": <SUPPLIER_location_uuid>,
  "toLocationUuid": “<STORE_location_uuid>,
  "change": 10
```
